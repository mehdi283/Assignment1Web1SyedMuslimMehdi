    <h1> My Favourite Dish Pizza Recipe</h1><br>
        <!--Main Heading of the page-->


<p><b>One of the most popular and recognized foods in the world is pizza. 
    A light, fluffy dough is prepared,<br> and several kinds of delicious toppings,
     including melting mozzarella cheese and glossy tomato sauce,<br> are added on top.
      A delicious experience is created by the mix of tastes. Pizza's creamy, juicy texture 
      and<br> a perfect mixture of cheese, sauce, and dough are the main reasons I love it. 
      Pizza is always a delicious treat,<br> whether it's prepared at home or from a restaurant.</b></p><br>
